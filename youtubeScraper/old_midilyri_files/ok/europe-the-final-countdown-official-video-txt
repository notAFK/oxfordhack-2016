(Joey Tempest) 
We're leaving together, 
But still it's farewell 
And maybe we'll come back, 
To earth, who can tell ? 
I guess there is no one to blame 
We're leaving ground 
Will things ever be the same again? 
It's the final countdown... 
We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall 
Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all 
With so many light years to go and things to be found 
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so
