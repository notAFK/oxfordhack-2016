Lyrics from the: Original Version
Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 
How you stopped needing me (needing me) 
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 
Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 
Just up and walked away (walked away) 
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 
Hey, uh, uh, oh baby baby 
I was upset and you know you shady 
Blame it on me like I'm fugazy 
I put in work and you got lazy 
Now you sayin it's shame on me 
You left with a chick with a set of double D's 
Why should we separate like Siamese 
Didn't anybody tell you sex better in threes 
I can be the reason that you both knock kneed 
If I tell my homie Zulee he wouldn't knock me 
Try to tell me lies, but you're so sloppy 
When you leave with your friends, they all jock me 
I understand if she know how to please you 
I understand if she lovin' And tease You 
In my right mind I should probably leave you 
Why can't all three of us be peoples
Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 
How you stopped needing me (needing me) 
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 
Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 
Just up and walked away (walked away) 
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 
Yo, please Listen 
Uh, uh, don't dip out baby 
I can live life fine with two ladies 
Two heads are better than the one God gave me 
And I'm messed up, been stressin' lately 
Please Tell Me, know you gotta feel how I feel 
Imagine us lounging together 
And I feel you, while you feel her, and she feel Me 
Love triangle, love in all angles 
If you spend more time, I won't trip or spazz out 
'Long as when we home we freak out 
And let your friends know exactly what we 'bout 
More heavy fam, we living our dreams out 
Sexy, I know you probably think you can be stress-free 
Without K.I.D., but you gon' see if you ever left, never get it better 
You'll miss me 
Ohh Baby, ohh baby, just talk to me, just tell me let's work it out 
Hey baby, I need you baby (both of yall) 
Baby, I need you baby (both of yall) 
I Need You Baby. 
Take my hand, baby girl let's roll
I can make you feel okay
Just take my hand, both of you, I can make you feel okay 
Okay 
Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 
How you stopped needing me (needing me) 
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 
Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 
Just up and walked away (walked away)
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 
How you stopped needing me (needing me) 
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 
Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 
Just up and walked away (walked away) 
When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
