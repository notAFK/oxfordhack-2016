I moved away. I got my head out of this mess and I've been saving up my breath in case I couldn't take that step to try and change every thought that sunk this ship. I've been swimming through these washed up lines. I saw the coast, it saved my life. Don't try and stop me. All we have holding ourselves down is our own pulse beating. All we have to rely on are memories. I can't forget. Your made your point when you said we fell apart. I had my words all chosen carefully. I broke your heart so gracefully. I watch your tears as you recite back every word. And every bridge I ever built, I'll sit back and watch them burn. Now don't sound so dramatic. You never meant a word you said. Your voice will fade to static and memories will just fade away
