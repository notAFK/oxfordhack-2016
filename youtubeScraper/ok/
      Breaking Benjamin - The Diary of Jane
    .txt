If I had to, I would put myself right beside youso let me ask, would you like that, would you like that, and I don´t mind if you say this love is a last time,so I ask do you like that? Do you like that? Somethings getting in the way,somethings just about to break,I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane,so tell me how we should turn? Try to find out,what makes you dare, cause I lay downsore and sick, do you like that?Do you like that? There´s a fineline,between love and hate and I don´t mind,cause let me say that I like that, I like that Somethings getting in the way, somethings just about to break,I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane As I burnin` all the pages,as i look the other way,I still try to find my place in the diary of Janeso tell me how we should turn? Desprate I will know waiting for some love,no love, there is no lovedie for anyone, horrable become Somethings getting in the way,somethings just about to break,I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane As I burnin` all the pages,as I look the other way,I still try to find my placein the diary of Jane.
