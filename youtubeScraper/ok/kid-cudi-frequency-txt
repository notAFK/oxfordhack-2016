Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 
How you stopped needing me (needing me) 


When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 

Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 

Just up and walked away (walked away) 

When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 



Hey, uh, uh, oh baby baby 

I was upset and you know you shady 

Blame it on me like I'm fugazy 

I put in work and you got lazy 

Now you sayin it's shame on me 

You left with a chick with a set of double D's 

Why should we separate like Siamese 

Didn't anybody tell you sex better in threes 

I can be the reason that you both knock kneed 

If I tell my homie Zulee he wouldn't knock me 

Try to tell me lies, but you're so sloppy 

When you leave with your friends, they all jock me 

I understand if she know how to please you 

I understand if she lovin' And tease You 

In my right mind I should probably leave you 

Why can't all three of us be peoples



Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 

How you stopped needing me (needing me) 

When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 

Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 

Just up and walked away (walked away) 

When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 



Yo, please Listen 

Uh, uh, don't dip out baby 

I can live life fine with two ladies 

Two heads are better than the one God gave me 

And I'm messed up, been stressin' lately 

Please Tell Me, know you gotta feel how I feel 

Imagine us lounging together 

And I feel you, while you feel her, and she feel Me 

Love triangle, love in all angles 

If you spend more time, I won't trip or spazz out 

'Long as when we home we freak out 

And let your friends know exactly what we 'bout 

More heavy fam, we living our dreams out 

Sexy, I know you probably think you can be stress-free 

Without K.I.D., but you gon' see if you ever left, never get it better 

You'll miss me 



Ohh Baby, ohh baby, just talk to me, just tell me let's work it out 

Hey baby, I need you baby (both of yall) 

Baby, I need you baby (both of yall) 

I Need You Baby. 



Take my hand, baby girl let's roll

I can make you feel okay

Just take my hand, both of you, I can make you feel okay 

Okay 



Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 

How you stopped needing me (needing me) 

When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 

Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 

Just up and walked away (walked away)

When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)



Strange, how you stopped loving me (loving me) 

How you stopped needing me (needing me) 

When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) 

Strange, you changed like night and day (night and day) 

Just up and walked away (walked away) 

When she came along (Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
