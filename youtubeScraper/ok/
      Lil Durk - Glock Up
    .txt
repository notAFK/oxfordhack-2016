My boys play no games
Keep must, need no aim
Lil Durk need no fame


 




Pints in, need codeine
2K for these Balmains


2K cause we ballin'

Bad bitch keep callin'

Poker face, we all in

Blockbuster, we pop up

Pussy boys ain't old enough

Keep your gun, we pop up

Don't try us, we glocked up

Homicide, I ain't seen none'

Pussy boy, while y'all mean mug

Pussy boy, while y'all mean mug

Pussy boy, while y'all mean mug



See us, them boys can't be us

Tweakers, why they be wifing eaters

E-Way, smoking, choking, coughing

Rollin' up on that Keisha

Guns down, man I can't leave 'em

Make sure that he don't see us

Run off on me, I guarantee my boys'll be to see him

64 hundred normal

Trap house be doin' numbers

Hundred just don't be stunting

You might make it through the summer

You ain't eat cause you thuggin'

Two two three shells like suckers

She say she cannot fuck off a xanny, she need a oven

Arrogant motherfucker

Runnin' off from the bubble

Felonies, I got double

See me, they know it's trouble

Shootin' shit, ain't no scuffle

Vernie, that boy the muscle

I be sippin' Actavis while them boys be sippin' 'Test



My boys play no games

You snatch this chain out in LA, this chopper gon' chop you

My bitch ass is A1, in love with her top too

Lil Buku will drop you

Leave your ass wet up, this chain I got is wet up

Don't trust no hoes, they set up

It's Louis V all over me, I swear I'm in a chess club

Streets gon' miss Bankroll, for him I keep a bankroll

Hate skank hoes, and I never wear the same clothes

Designer, ain't it ain't too hard to find us

Got killers off in Atlanta, and I cop drink from the mana

Excuse, I ain't got no manners
