Greetings from Eros
 God of sexual desire, son of Aphrodite 
Lay back and feast as this audio guides you 


 




Through new and exciting positions


I wanna be the Girl Under You (oh yeah)

 I wanna be your G.U.Y, oh yeah

 I wanna be the grave and earth you (oh yeah) 

Our sexes tell us no lies



I'm gonna wear the tower, want the power to leave you

 I'm aimin' for full control of this love (of this love)

 Touch me, Touch me, Don't be sweet 

Love me, love me, please retweet 

Let me be the girl under you that makes you cry



I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)

 I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)

 I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.) 

The Girl Under you, Guy



I'm gonna say the word 

And own you You'll be my G.I.R.L 

Got our romance and loves to hold you 

Know you'll wear my make-up well



I'm gonna wear the tower, want the power to leave you 

I'm aimin' for full control of this love (of this love)

 Touch me, Touch me, Don't be sweet

 Love me, love me, please retweet 

Let me be the girl under you that makes you cry



I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.) 

I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)

 I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.) 

The Girl Under you, Guy



I don't need to be on top to know I'm wanted 

Cuz I'm strong enough to know the truth 

I just want it to be hot because I'm blessed 

When I'm in Love and I'm in Love with you



(Touch Me, Touch Me) 

Mount your Goddess 

(Touch Me, Touch Me) 

A summer moon comes into full phase 

(Get on top of me) 

And Mars' warm Spirit rams into the Atmosphere

Touch me touch me, don't be shy 

I'm in charge like a G.U.Y

 I'll lay down face up this time

 Under you like a G.U.Y



I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)

 I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)  

I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.) 

The Girl Under you G.U.Y.



I wanna be that guy (G.U.Y.)

 I'll wrap you right up, Guy (G.U.Y) 

I'll lie down face up, Guy (G.U.Y.) 

The Girl Under you G.U.Y.
