Everyone is coming home
You can hear the sound from miles
I try to turn it up
They turn it down
The only noise is from the ground
And I know
They're just curious
And they stand
And they look at us
Oh oh
Oh oh
Everyone who knows the law
Wants to cops or hear they know
Try to lock you up
You lock it in
The line between us is so thin
And I know
They're just curious
And they stand
And they look at us
Oh oh
Oh oh
The candle the burned out
The candle burned
Oh, the candle burned out [x4]
Oh oh
The Candle Burned out
They try to lock you up (the candle burned out)
They try to lock you up (the candle burned out)
They try to lock you up (Oh the candle burned out)
