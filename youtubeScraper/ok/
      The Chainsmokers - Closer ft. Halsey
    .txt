Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them


 




But I hope I never see them again



I know it breaks your heart

Moved to the city in a broke down car and

Four years, no calls

Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and

I can't stop

No, I can't stop



So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover

That I know you can't afford

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner

Of the mattress that you stole

From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older



We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older



You look as good as the day I met you

I forget just why I left you, I was insane

Stay, and play that Blink-182 song

That we beat to death in Tuscon, okay

We ain't ever getting older (no we ain't ever getting older)
