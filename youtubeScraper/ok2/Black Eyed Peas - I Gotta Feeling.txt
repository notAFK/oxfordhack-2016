I gotta a feeling, that tonight's gonna be a good night,
that tonight's gonna be a good night,
that tonight's gonna be.

Tonight's the night,
let's live it up,
I got my money,
let's spend it up,
go out and smash it,
like, oh my god,
jump off that sofa,
let's get, get off.

'Cause tonight's gonna be a good night,
tonight's gonna be a good night,
baby, tonight's gonna be.

I know that we'll have a ball,
if we just go out and we just lose it all,
I feel stressed out and I wanna let it go,
feel I'm loosing, losing control.

Got a feeling,
that baby, tonight's gonna be a good night,
tonight's gonna be a good night,
baby, tonight's gonna be.

Fill up my cup,
mozoltov,
look at her dancing,
just take it off,
let's paint the town,
we'll shut it down,
let's burn the roof, oh and then we'll do it again,
let's do it,[x6]
let's do it,[x2]
let's do it, do it, do it
let's do it.[x3]

'Cause I got a feeling,
tonight's gonna be a good night,
baby, tonight's gonna be a good night,
baby, tonight's gonna be,
'cause I got a feeling.
