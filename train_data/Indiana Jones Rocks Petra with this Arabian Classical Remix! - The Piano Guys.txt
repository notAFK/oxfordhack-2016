Of an absolution
and you'll see
Of an absolution


 
 In the night-light, do you see what you dream
All your troubles, are they all what they seem


Look around you then you may realize

All the preachers all with their lies

And i might know of our future

But then you still control the past

Only you now if you'll be together

Only you know if we shall last

 (of an absolution)

 In the nightlight, do you still feel your pain

For the valour you wait... it never came

If you were able, would you go change the past

To mend a faux pas with one last chance

And i might know of our future

But then you still control the past

Only you now if you'll be together

Tonight



Cause every night i will save your life

And every night i will be with you

Cause every night i still lay awake

And i dream of an absolution

Cause every night i will make it right

And every night i will come to you

But every night it just stays the same

In my dream of an absolution

 (of an absolution)

 In the night-light, do you see what you dream

All your triumph and all you'll never be

Look around you, then you may realize

Happiness lies trapped in misery

And who knows what of our future

We can all try to change our past

Only you now if you'll be together

Tonight



Cause every night i will save your life

And every night i will be with you

Cause every night i still lake awake

And i dream of an absolution

Cause every night i will make it right

And every night i will come to you

But every night it just stays the same

In my dream of an absolution



Cause every night i will save your life

And every night i will be with you

Cause every night i still lay awake

And i dream of an absolution

Cause every night i will make it right

And every night i will come to you

But every night it just stays the same

In my dream of an absolution

 (of an absolution)

 Cause every night i will save your life

And every night i will be with you

Cause every night i still lay awake

And i dream of an absolution

Cause every night i will make it right

And every night i will come to you

But every night it just stays the same

In my dream of an absolution

  And you'll see 

What you'll be 

And you'll see 

All you can be 

oh

Cause every night 

And every night 

And every night 

I will dream
