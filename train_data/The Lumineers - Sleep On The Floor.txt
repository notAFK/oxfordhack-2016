Pack yourself a toothbrush dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out


 
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out


I was not born to drown, baby come on



Forget what Father Brennan said

We were not born in sin

Leave a note on your bed

Let your mother know you're safe

And by the time she wakes

We'll have driven through the state

We'll have driven through the night, baby come on



If the sun don't shine on me today

And if the subways flood and bridges break

Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave

Or will you rail against your dying day



And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky

How do you pay the rent, is it your parents

Or is hard work dear, holding the atmosphere

I don't wanna live like that



If the sun don't shine on me today

If the subways flood and bridges break



Jesus Christ can't save me tonight

Put on your dress, yes wear something nice

Decide on me, yea decide on us

Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois



Pack yourself a toothbrush dear

Pack yourself a favorite blouse

Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out

Cause if we don't leave this town

We might never make it out
