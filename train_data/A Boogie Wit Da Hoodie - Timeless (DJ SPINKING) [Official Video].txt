I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, I'm 'bout it


 
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent a 100 thousand on fly shit


QP spent a 100 thousand on mollies

Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'

2 seater Bentley and it's topless

And she's topless, naked bitch driver

Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour

I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless

I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...



I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'

If I ever said, "I love you," I was lyin'

Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded

Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas

Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish

I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it

I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless

I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
