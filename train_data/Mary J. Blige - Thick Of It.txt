Love ain't just black and white
Ain't that simple
It gets hard to tell whose wrong or right


 
When Its dark with us
I swear I barely see the light


Should I stick it out?

Are you worth this fight?

Are we worth this fight?

Cuz I ain't no quitter babe

And I be damned if all these years I let you diss me babe

I was there when no one wanted to stay with you baby

You know I deserve more than this

I do



So tell me who

Who's gonna love

You like I do

Who will you trust

I gave you too much

Enough is enough

Now we’re in the thick of it

So tell me

Who's gonna love

You like I do

Who will you trust

I gave you too much

Enough is enough

Now were in the

Now we’re in the thick of it



What a hell of a year

If I make it through hell and I come out alive I got nothing to fear

No more crying and trying

And bring back this loving when nothing is here

Let me be clear

I wasn’t perfect

But this shit ain't worth it

I’m done with the mess

I confess on the stress

And I know Ima look back and call it a blessing

Cuz I ain't no quitter babe

But I be damned if all these years I let you diss me babe

I was there when no one wanted to stay with you baby

You know I deserve more than this

I do



So tell me who

Who's gonna love

You like I do

Who will you trust

I gave you too much

Enough is enough

Now we’re in the thick of it

So tell me who

Who's gonna love

You like I do

Who will you trust

I gave you too much

Enough is enough

Now we’re in the

We’re in the thick of it



Boy you had someone who really loved you

(boy you had someone who really loved you)

Should have held on held on real tight now

(held on tight)

And she placed no other one above you

(and she placed no one above you)

But you didn’t want to treat her right now

Should’ve let her go

Should’ve let her go

Oh no oh, oh no oh

Now I’m letting go

Now I’m letting go

Oh no oh, oh no oh



So tell me who

Who's gonna love

You like I do

Who will you trust

I gave you too much

Enough is enough

Now we’re in the thick of it

So tell me who

Who's gonna love

You like I do

Who will you trust

I gave you too much

Enough is enough

Now we’re in the

We’re in the thick of it
