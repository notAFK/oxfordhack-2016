This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing


 
Yes it's the final thing
When the nights is cold and lonely




Was it the money that made me a savage?

Poppin' them percs and I made it a habit

Totin' them pictures and serving them addicts

That was exciting to me

I'm so excited to be

Started with nothin' we had to inspire to be

Niggas ain't flyer than me

I'm getting to it

Feel like the man, I got the plan

I call the shooters, they hop out the van

Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan

Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham

I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas

Do magic like alakazam

I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie

Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty

Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie

To light up the city like Meechie 03

I got the plug, he send him up T

Don't know these niggas, these niggas know me

Even though niggas they call me OG

Young nigga but I put it down

We was on it when it wasn't 'round

All of sudden niggas wanna come around

Stay over there my G



Do me one favor

Take a few steps back

And look at yourself

Matter fact, take yourself outside your body... and then look at yourself

And see how you playing yourself nigga

Congratulations

It's the motherfuckin' Chasers

You feel me

We on it



This is my blues

'Cause I'm back down on my own again

This is the blues I'm playing

Yes it's the final thing

When the nights is cold and lonely



Pay you the plug

Try to be real with some niggas and put em on money and show em some love

You did me a favor, I knew you was shiesty, I knew you would show who you was

It's only a matter of time before niggas get lying and hit with them slugs

Get found in a pool of your blood, yeah nigga

'Member they told me that we would fail

'Member they said we would see a cell

Down with that semi like Cam Newton, I'm in the field like the NFL

Niggas is kickin', I wish em well

I made a wish in a wishing well

I put a brick in a wishing well

Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail

No disease but I'm sick of cells

Sick and tired of sending niggas mail

Calling niggas just to get a bail

I just seen a nigga get a L

Never coming home, minute on the phone, sick and tired of seeing niggas fail

Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose

Sinning like we tryna get to hell



This is my blues

'Cause I'm back down on my own again

This is the blues I'm playing

Yes it's the final thing

When the nights is cold and lonely

This is the midnight blues
