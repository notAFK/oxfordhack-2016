[Hook: Mac Miller]
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill
It's a motherfuckin barbeque for real


 
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time


Put a little gin in the punch

Grandma getting crunked, just fine

Nobody give a fuck

All these days already gone by

Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time



[Verse 1: Mac Miller]

The door's open, I might as well just stroll in

Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan

Ryan, try it once and then you go there

I am hoping that we can kick it

Reminiscing only about the good times

I know there's moments

When you probably love me but you didn't wanna show it

Now I'm all around the globe

With everyone but you

I know you fuckin miss me

Chill and keep it cool! Never getting old mane

Grown, no Rogaine. Boy you play with all that food

You better eat the whole thing!

It's a family reunion, all the grandmas be moving

Running in 3-legged races people would cry if they losing

When I was 2, my fly was blue

When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand

When my, bike was all I was riding on

Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it I was happy still

It's a motherfuckin' barbeque for real

Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time

Grandma getting crunked, just fine

Nobody give a fuck

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]

Come and, step inside the Electric Slide

Spraying squirt guns at you like it's pesticides

So why you buggin'... lil man stop bugging...

I gotta, spend some time, with some friends of mine

Get away from everything, go and rest your mind

It's not nothing... lil man it's not nothing...

All my little cousins acting like some munchkins

Running in the trees and they're crying out their eyes

Have to rush em to the ER - maybe just a Band-Aid will do it

You can sing along please, let the band play the music

Always nice when you come back home

Your friends go up but then they come back grown

Nice to know that you're never alone

Family reunions whenever I'm home

Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill

It's a muthafuckin barbeque for real

Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time

Grandma getting crunked, just fine

Nobody give a fuck
