So now this ship is sinking
I don’t know what to do
It’s got me thinking that I don’t need


 
Don’t need you
Too many wrong decisions


You didn’t think this through

So what I’m saying is I don’t need

Don’t need you



Open your eyes and see

What we have become

This isn’t living, it’s existing

And I just can’t take this shit

And hurt anymore

Hurt anymore



So bury me with all you got

It never stops never ends gotta try and

Let it out let it go

Is this the end?

‘Cause it might just break me

Look at us now we’re fucked

And nothing’s the same

The biggest piece of me is missing and I just can’t

Take this life or try anymore

I just don’t care so come and...



Bury me with all you got

It never stops never ends gotta try and

Let it out let it go

Is this the end?

‘Cause it might just break me

(Might just break me)

Is it too late to make amends

It never stops it never ends

Is it too late to make amends
