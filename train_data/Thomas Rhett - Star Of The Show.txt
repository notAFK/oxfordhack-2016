Walking down the street hand in mine
it don't keep them other guys and their wondering eyes from looking at you
that's alright and that's ok, who can blame 'em anyway 


 
you're so pretty and you ain't even got a clue what you do
cuz everywhere we go girl you're the star of the show


and everybody's wondering and wanting to know, whats your name?

who's that girl with the prettiest smile in the world?

oh what gets me the most is you don't even know

that you are, you are, you are the star of the show



Friday night on the town, we walk in and you draw a crowd

even the band seems to sing for you

ease on up, order a drink, barkeep says its all on me 

you look at me and laugh like you don't know what to do

baby you're so cute



cuz everywhere we go girl you're the star of the show

and everybody's wondering and wanting to know, whats your name?

who's that girl with the prettiest smile in the world?

oh what gets me the most is you don't even know

that you are, you are, you are the star of the show, yeah

you are the star of the show..



Even in a ponytail and a pair over jeans you look like a cover 

of a magazine, baby you're the only one who doesn't see



that everywhere we go you're the star of the show

and everyone's wondering and wanting to know, whats your name?

who's that girl with the luckiest guy in the world?

oh what gets me the most is you don't even know

that you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, baby you are, you are, you are, you are, the star of the show..

baby you're the star of the show...
