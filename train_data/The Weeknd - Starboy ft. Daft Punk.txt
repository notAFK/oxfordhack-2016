I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah


 
All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah

Side bitch out of your league too, ah...



House so empty, need a centerpiece

Twenty racks a table, carved from ebony

Cut that ivory into skinny pieces

Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby

You talking money, need a hearing aid

You talking bout me, I don't see a shade

Switch out my side, I'll take any lane

I switch out my car if I kill any pain



(Ha-ha-ha...) Look what you've done

(Ha-ha-ha...) I'm a motherfucking Starboy

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah

Every day a nigga try to end me, ah

Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah

Pockets overweight, getting hefty, ah

Coming for the king, that's a far cry, I

I come alive in the fall time, I

The competition, I don't really listen

I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition



House so empty, need a centerpiece

Let a nigga Brad Pitt

Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit

Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon

Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish

Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan

Girls get loose when they hear this song

100 on the dash get me close to God

We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
