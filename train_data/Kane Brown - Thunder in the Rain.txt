Your lips, your eyes, don't wanna let go
Your skin on mine, I'm losing control
Hear the rumble in your chest


 
Feel the wind comin' off your breath
Your curves ain't slow me down


Ain't nothin' gonna stop us now



You're fire, I'm lightnin'

We're burnin' at the core

Fallin' and crashin'

Girl, we're a perfect storm

Every time our hearts collide

I can feel our love come alive

It's insane, baby

We're like thunder in the rain



Twisted, tangled like a hurricane

We shake these walls like an earthquake

Hear the rumble in your chest

Feel the wind comin' off your breath

The way you're callin' out my name

Makes me hard to contain



You're fire, I'm lightnin'

We're burnin' at the core

Fallin' and crashin'

Girl, we're a perfect storm

Every time our hearts collide

I can feel our love come alive

It's insane, baby

We're like thunder in the rain

We're like thunder in the rain



You're fire, I'm lightnin'

We're burnin' at the core

Fallin' and crashin'

Girl, we're a perfect storm



You're fire, I'm lightnin'

We're burnin' at the core

Fallin' and crashin'

Girl, we're a perfect storm

Every time our hearts collide

I can feel our love come alive

It's insane, baby

We're like thunder in the rain

We're like thunder in the rain
