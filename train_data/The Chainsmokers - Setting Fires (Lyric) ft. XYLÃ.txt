Down to my last match fire I touch just to feel
Why is it easier to burn than it is to heal?



 
Out in the cold you've been
I begged you to come back in


But I can't do this again



I can't keep you from harm

But I'm set on fire to keep you warm

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't keep you from harm

But I'm set on fire to keep you warm

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm



I can't

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm



I've been looking for answers I don't want to hear

Chest to chest with you I'm staring into a mirror



Out in the cold you've been

I begged you to come back in

But I can't do this again



I can't keep you from harm

But I'm set on fire to keep you warm

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't keep you from harm

But I'm set on fire to keep you warm

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm



I can't

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm



What would I do?

What I wouldn't do to save you

What would I do?

What I wouldn't do to save you



I can't keep you from harm

But I'm set on fire to keep you warm

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't keep you from harm

But I'm set on fire to keep you warm

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm



I can't

I can't

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't

I can't

I can't go on and on

Setting fires to keep you warm
