I don't blame you
We got carried away
I can't hold on


 
To an empty space



Now you've found a new star to orbit

It could be love

I think you're too soon to call us old

When and where did we go cold?

I thought I had you on hold



And every time I let you leave

I always saw you coming back to me

When and where did we go cold?

I thought I had you on hold



Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body

Dare me to, dare me to

Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body



I thought I had you on hold



Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body

Dare me to, dare me to

Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body

Dare me to, dare me to



My young heart chose to believe

We were destined

Young hearts

All need love

Call it a lesson

The stars and the charts

And the cards make sense

Only when we want them to

When I lie awake staring in to space

I see a different view



Now you've found a new star to orbit

It could be love

I think you're too soon to call us old

When and where did we go cold?

I thought I had you on hold



And every time I let you leave

I always saw you coming back to me

When and where did we go cold?

I thought I had you on hold

I thought I had you on hold

I thought I had you on hold



Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body

Where do you dare me to, dare me to

Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body

You've got the body, you've got the body

Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body

Where do you dare me to, dare me to

Where does it stop, where does it stop

Where do you dare me to

You've got the body, you've got the body

Dare me to, dare me to



And every time I let you leave

I always saw you coming back to me

When and where did we all go cold?

I thought I had you on hold

I thought I had you on hold

I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave

I always saw you coming back to me

When and where did we all go cold?

I thought I had you on hold

I thought I had you on hold

I thought I had you on hold
