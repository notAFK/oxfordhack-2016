I got a bad bitch and she feisty
Red bottoms on, no Nike's
I'm a Aries, she a Pisces


 
We fuck, clean it up with a white T
And she don't wanna be no wifey


I'm a dub, she a dime piece

She never wear the same clothes twice

I hit it raw, yeah, I roll the dice

Eat it 'fore I beat it, I'm a coochie eater

Fucked her in my chucks and my white beater

Taste like water, smell like Chanel

Pussy wetter than a wishing well

She keep saying she gone leave me

But she don't cause she need me



Fuck her from the back cause love is blind

Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign

Fuck her from the back cause love is blind

Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign

Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign

Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign

Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign



She told me fuck her like a gangster

Choke her out, pull her and spank her

Dick won't fit, use my fingers

She only want me cause I'm famous

I met her at the supper club

We fucked on the first night

Big booty, brown skin

Say my name when I'm pounding

Pounding, pounding

Bust once, she told me put another round in

She said my dick bigger than a mountain

Let her ride just to stretch it out

But first I put it in her mouth

Then I hit it from the back cause love is blind



Fuck her from the back cause love is blind

Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign

Fuck her from the back cause love is blind

Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign

Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign

Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign

Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign

And pick it up pick it up, pick it up, slow down

All my ladies it drop, real low

And pick it up pick it, up pick it up, slow down
