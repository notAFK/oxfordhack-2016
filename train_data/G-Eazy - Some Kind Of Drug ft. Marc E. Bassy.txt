You shoveled all their shit now
Here's some more, go on, dig down
Surprise son, it's your grave mound


 
Jump in before they come 'round
You ate all you were fed then


Found it less than appealing

You: Something else, man?

Them: Sorry, not an option.

Everything went tits up and everything shit the bed

Your relationships (you stupid kid)

Your scholarships (you dumb dick)

Your life that fit (no chance in)

It's all on the skids.
