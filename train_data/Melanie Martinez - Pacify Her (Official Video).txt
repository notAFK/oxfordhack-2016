Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girls hand
That basic bitch leaves finally


 
Now I can take her man



Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours

But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?



Pacify her

She’s getting on my nerves

You don’t love her

Stop lying with those words (2x)



I can’t stand her whining

Where’s her binky now?

And loving her seems tiring

So boy, just love me, down, down, down



Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours

But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?



Pacify her

She’s getting on my nerves

You don’t love her

Stop lying with those words



Pacify her

She’s getting on my nerves

You don’t love her

Stop lying with those words (2x)
