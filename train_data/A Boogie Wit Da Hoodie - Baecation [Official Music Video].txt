I took her on a baecation
She fell in love with the way I tasted
I fell in love with the way she take it


 
Go down on it girl, I know you wanna taste it
I took her on a baecation


We ain't even really dating

I spent a long time waiting

Go down on me girl, I'm running out of patience



My name is Artist, I can draw shit

She be all up in my phone, she just wanna start shit

She will not leave me alone till I take her shopping

Louis bag with a stash and her Birkin wallet

Yeah, let's go on a baecation

Baby, we can go to Vegas and change locations

Don't you worry bout a hater, they gon' keep hating

They sendin' shots, I just dodge like I'm in the Matrix

Used to school park in the Uber

Now we taking flights, spending nights in Aruba

I hope we can do a lot of things, fuck the rumors

On the beach, Henny Coladas in the cooler

All the hoes gon' follow, understand that

If you end up heart broken I didn't plan that

I wanna take you so far I don't know where to begin at

Baby girl at least you know where my head at



So, I took her on a baecation

She fell in love with the way I tasted

I fell in love with the way she take it

Go down on me girl, I know you wanna taste it

I took her on a baecation

We ain't even really dating

I spent a long time

Go down on me girl, I know you want



I could put you on, I won't do you wrong baby

You know what you're doing, I just hope you don't play me

Louis Vuitton don, you know I be going crazy

Go to San Juan, put you on the front page and

If they hate girl, fuck 'em they can stay hating

You can whip the Benzi, let 'em watch us racing and

When they hear me on the radio station

They gon' wish they was you but I ain't replacing

My bitch so expensive

She listen to me but she never listen

They tried to push me off my pivot but I'm never tripping

She never bitch and love to kick it, Rose sipping

I fuck with you but girl don't get it twisted

It's money over everything so I be getting chicken

I'm hard to get with so they never got the cash, be slipping

Put you on a private jet, fuck a plane ticket



So, I took her on a baecation

She fell in love with the way I tasted

I fell in love with the way she take it

Go down on me girl, I know you wanna taste it
